# Deploy SAP NetWeaver (ASCS, PAS) with HANA to Azure
*You agree to the dislaimer mentioned at the bottom of this page, when you proceed further with the details and steps given below.*

This creates infrastructure on Microsoft Azure and installs SAP HANA DB software, including Netweaver ABAP. The SID number for the NW system is S40.    
It takes about 45-60 minutes for full deployment process to complete. Please follow the steps mentioned below:    

## Getting ready:  
Create Service Principal using Azure Cloud Shell /AZ CLI with command "az ad sp create-for-rbac". Save details as you'll need those later.    
If you use an existing Service Principal, please make sure to copy appId and password/secret correctly.

## Important note:
Make sure you deploy the solution into a resource group which conforms to the naming conventions for Terraform/Ansible. This basically means no upper case letters, nor special characters like underscore. If in doubt, an all-lowercase RG name will work perfectly fine.

## To deploy SAP NetWeaver (ASCS, PAS) with HANA, Click the button below:  

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fsanjeevkumar761%2Fone_touch_sap_deployment_on_azure%2Fmaster%2Fs4hana-infra-and-sw%2Fazuredeploy.json)

## How to check installation progress:   
1\) Wait for initial deployment to complete in Azure portal. You'll see the message "Your deployment is complete" in Azure portal. It deploys a jumpbox on Azure  
2\) Go to your Resource Group in Azure portal, locate the VM named "jumpboxlinux" and look for its Public IP address  
3\) *Wait for about 10 minutes* for installation monitoring layer inside jumpboxlinux VM to be ready \(It prepares automatically in background\)   
4\) Now, you can check installation progress on URL http://\<public IP of your jumpboxlinux VM\>:3000  \(you need to refresh the page manually to check progress until the Deployment progress reaches 100% which takes about 40-50 minutes)  
5\) You can check detailed installation logs on URL http://\<public IP of your jumpboxlinux VM\>:9001  

## Connect to HANA DB and confirm it is up and running:      
1\) SSH into jumpboxlinx VM with its Public IP address using Putty or other SSH tool ( user: juser, password: Welcome@123 )   
2\) Switch to root by using command "sudo su"  
3\) SSH into HANA DB VM using command "ssh demo@hanadb" (accept key fingerprint of HANA DB VM when it prompts, by typing yes)  
4\) Inside HANA DB VM, switch to HANA admin user by using command "sudo su - hn1adm"  
5\) Check status of HANA DB processes by using command "sapcontrol -nr 00 -function GetProcessList". You should be able to notice that status of all HANA DB processes is GREEN.  

## How to snooze (stop/start) HANA DB VM and jumpbox VM:      
1\) To stop HANA DB, SSH to HANA DB VM, stop HANA processes by using command "sapcontrol -nr 00 -Function Stop"  
2\) Stop HANA DB VM from Azure portal  
3\) Stop jumpboxlinux VM from Azure portal  
4\) To start HANA DB next time, start jumpboxlinux VM from Azure portal  
5\) SSH into jumpboxlinux and then SSH into HANA DB VM  
6\) Switch to HANA admin user by using command "sudo su - hn1adm" and run command "sapcontrol -nr 00 -Function Start" .  

## Advanced - How to check detailed installation trace:     
1\) You can login to jumpbox VM as soon as it is shows Running state in Azure portal  
2\) You can switch to root by using "sudo su" and change directory to waagent using "cd /var/lib/waagent/custom-script/download/0"  
3\) Now you can check "stdout" and "stderr" files.
