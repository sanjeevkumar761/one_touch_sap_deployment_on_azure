# Souvenir App Station: Deploy Souvenir Apps for SAP on Azure
*You agree to the dislaimer mentioned at the bottom of this page, when you proceed further with the details and steps given below.*

This creates infrastructure on Microsoft Azure and installs SAP HANA, ASCS and CI instances for S4HANA1909.     
It takes about 120-150 minutes for full deployment process to complete. Please follow the steps mentioned below:    

## Getting ready:  
Create Service Principal using Azure Cloud Shell /AZ CLI with command "az ad sp create-for-rbac". Save details as you'll need those later.    
If you use exitsing Service Principal, please make sure to copy appId and password/secret correctly.  

## To deploy Souvenir Apps for SAP on Azure, Click the button below:  

Click Deploy to Azure button to install Souvenir SAP on Azure App Station

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fsanjeevkumar761%2Fone_touch_sap_deployment_on_azure%2Fmaster%2Fsouvenir-sap-azure-apps%2Fazuredeploy.json)  

## Do the following steps to proceed with S4HANA installation:  
1) Check if jumpboxlinux deployment is complete on Azure  
2) After above step, wait for 10 minutes for App Station installation to complete  
3) Now in a web browser, open URL http://\<public IP of your jumpboxlinux VM>:3000/token \   
4) Copy token by selecting all contents of above token  
5) Now in a new web browser tab, open App Station URL http://\<public IP of your jumpboxlinux VM>:8080/#/c/default/ns/sap-azure-apps/apps/one-touch-sap-deployment  \  
6) Enter token contents in token input box and click Login button  
7) Now you can see in app notes that one-touch-sap-deployment app runs on URL http://\<public IP of your jumpboxlinux VM>:8081 . So, in a browser tab, open URL http://<public IP of your jumpboxlinux VM>:8081  \  
8) Now enter the required details it asks for and submit for S/4HANA installation.  

## How to check installation progress:   
1\) Wait for initial deployment to complete in Azure portal. You'll see the message "Your deployment is complete" in Azure portal. It deploys a jumpbox on Azure  
2\) Go to your Resource Group in Azure portal, locate the VM named "jumpboxlinux" and look for its Public IP address  
3\) *Wait for about 10 minutes* for installation monitoring layer inside jumpboxlinux VM to be ready \(It prepares automatically in background\)   
4\) Now, you can check installation progress on URL http://\<public IP of your jumpboxlinux VM\>:8081/progress  \(you need to refresh the page manually to check progress until the Deployment progress reaches 100% which takes about 40-50 minutes)  
5\) You can download detailed installation logs on URL e.g., http://\<public IP of your jumpboxlinux VM\>:8081/download?logtpye=terraformhana  

## Connect using SAP GUI:        
1\) Install a Windows jumpbox and logon to Windows jumpbox    
2\) Download file "sapgui-download-extract.ps1" from here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanjeevkumar761/one_touch_sap_deployment_on_azure/master/s4hana-infra-and-sw/scripts/sapgui-download-extract.ps1   (This step will take about 10-15 minutes)  
3\) Open Powershell and cd into directory "C:\Users\juser"  
4\) Run powershell script by typing on command line "sapgui-download-extract.ps1" and hit Enter  
5\) Wait for SAP GUI zip file for download and extract SAP GUI software. It will start SAP GUI installer    
6\) Click Next, Select "SAP GUI for Windows....", click Next and wait for SAP GUI installation to complete  
7\) Click Close to complete SAP GUI installation  
8\) Double click SAP GUI Logon shortcut on Desktop, Click Next and Create new connection entry in SAP GUI with these details:    
Description: S4HANA  
System ID: S40  
Instance Number: 00  
Application Server: 10.0.0.7  
9\) Click Finish and click Logon   
10\) Now you can logon to S4HANA system by entering user details.  

## Connect to HANA DB and confirm it is up and running:      
1\) SSH into jumpboxlinx VM with its Public IP address using Putty or other SSH tool ( user: juser, password: Welcome@123 )   
2\) Switch to root by using command "sudo su"  
3\) SSH into HANA DB VM using command "ssh demo@hanadb" (accept key fingerprint of HANA DB VM when it prompts, by typing yes)  
4\) Inside HANA DB VM, switch to HANA admin user by using command "sudo su - hn1adm"  
5\) Check status of HANA DB processes by using command "sapcontrol -nr 00 -function GetProcessList". You should be able to notice that status of all HANA DB processes is GREEN.  

## How to snooze (stop/start) HANA DB VM and jumpbox VM:      
1\) To stop HANA DB, SSH to HANA DB VM, stop HANA processes by using command "sapcontrol -nr 00 -Function Stop"  
2\) Stop HANA DB VM from Azure portal  
3\) Stop jumpboxlinux VM from Azure portal  
4\) To start HANA DB next time, start jumpboxlinux VM from Azure portal  
5\) SSH into jumpboxlinux and then SSH into HANA DB VM  
6\) Switch to HANA admin user by using command "sudo su - hn1adm" and run command "sapcontrol -nr 00 -Function Start" .  

## Advanced - How to check detailed installation trace:     
1\) You can login to jumpbox VM as soon as it is shows Running state in Azure portal  
2\) You can switch to root by using "sudo su" and change directory to waagent using "cd /var/lib/waagent/custom-script/download/0"  
3\) Now you can check "stdout" and "stderr" files.
